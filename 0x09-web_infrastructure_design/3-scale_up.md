##project description

the project shows a more complext structure that has a higher level of scalability with all SPOFs eliminated and GNU/Linux servers have been used to increase the efficiency of the network. The SSL certificate is not terminated at the load-balancer, hence each of the servers are protected with an intermediary firewall

##key issues with the infrastructure

The infrastruture would need hight maintenance costs as well as cost of setup with more acquisition of servers
